# Rural Youth Development

## Introduction:
	Rural youth development refers to the efforts and initiatives aimed at empowering and supporting the growth of young individuals residing in rural areas. Mainly focuses on addressing the specific needs, challenges and opportunities faced by rural youth. It involves empowering rural youth through educational support, skill development, entrepreneurship opportunities, and access to projects that contribute to their personal and economic growth. By investing in rural youth development, we can foster a brighter future for rural communities and ensure their long-term sustainability.
